# Redux: basic counter example
An introductory example to the workflow of redux.

## How to run this example
1. Make sure your node modules are installed (as part of the whole "redux-samples" project).
```
npm install
```
2. Run using `node -r esm src/<directory>`. The esm library loaded through -r allows us to use the import/export functionality of ES6 within node.
